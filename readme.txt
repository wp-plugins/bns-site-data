----
= Shortcode: bns_site_data =
Parameters are very similar to the plugin:

* 'posts'       => true,
* 'pages'       => true,
* 'categories'  => true,
* 'tags'        => true,
* 'comments'    => true,
* 'attachments' => true,

NB: Use the shortcode at your own risk!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this in more than one widget area? =
Yes, this plugin has been made for multi-widget compatibility. Each instance of the widget will display, if wanted, differently than every other instance of the widget.

= Where can I get help with this plugin? =
Please note, support may be available on the WordPress Support forums; but, it may be faster to visit one of the following sites:

- https://github.com/Cais/bns-site-data/issues/
- http://buynowshop.com/plugins/bns-site-data/

= Why does my site not look like the screenshot? =
The screenshot was taken as an example when the plugin is used with the Twenty Ten theme. How the widget displays is strongly affected by the active theme styles.
I would recommend creating and using the 'bns-site-data-custom-style.css' stylesheet to set the style according to your own tastes and preferences.

== Screenshots ==
